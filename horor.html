                  In 1977, paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine
                  Warren come out of a self-imposed sabbatical to travel to Enfield, a
                  borough in north London. There, they meet Peggy Hodgson, an
                  overwhelmed single mother of four who tells the couple that something
                  evil is in her home. Ed and Lorraine believe her story when the
                  youngest daughter starts to show signs of demonic possession. As the
                  Warrens try to help the besieged girl, they become the next targets of
                  the malicious spirit.</br>

                  Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) becomes winter caretaker at the
                  isolated Overlook Hotel in Colorado, hoping to cure his writer's
                  block. He settles in along with his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and
                  his son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), who is plagued by psychic premonitions.
                  As Jack's writing goes nowhere and Danny's visions become more
                  disturbing, Jack discovers the hotel's dark secrets and begins to
                  unravel into a homicidal maniac hell-bent on terrorizing his family.</br>

                  On a cold Halloween night in 1963, six year old Michael Myers brutally
                  murdered his 17-year-old sister, Judith. He was sentenced and locked
                  away for 15 years. But on October 30, 1978, while being transferred
                  for a court date, a 21-year-old Michael Myers steals a car and escapes
                  Smith's Grove. He returns to his quiet hometown of Haddonfield,
                  Illinois, where he looks for his next victims.</br>

                  Several Midwestern teenagers fall prey to Freddy Krueger (Robert
                  Englund), a disfigured midnight mangler who preys on the teenagers in
                  their dreams -- which, in turn, kills them in reality. After
                  investigating the phenomenon, Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) begins to
                  suspect that a dark secret kept by her and her friends' parents may be
                  the key to unraveling the mystery, but can Nancy and her boyfriend
                  Glen (Johnny Depp) solve the puzzle before it's too late?</br>
